## Terraform CI/CD Automation With Jenkins
###### Project ToolBox ðŸ§°
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Git will be used to manage our application source code.
- [Github](https://github.com/) Github is a free and open source distributed VCS designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Jenkins is an open source automation CI tool which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) Snyk gives you the visibility, context, and control you need to work alongside developers on reducing application risk. 
- [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) Checkov scans cloud infrastructure configurations to find misconfigurations before they're deployed.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) Slack is a communication platform designed for collaboration which can be leveraged to build and develop a very robust DevOps culture. Will be used for Continuous feedback loop.

# Complete Terraform Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Project

A full end-to-end CI/CD pipeline built using Terraform and Jenkins, designed to provision infrastructure, build, test, and deploy applications in AWS, with automated scans and alerts integrated.

## Overview

This project provides a robust CI/CD pipeline which automates:

- Infrastructure provisioning in AWS using Terraform (VPCs, S3, RDS, Security Groups, etc.)  
- Setting up Jenkins server (on EC2) to act as the CI/CD orchestrator  
- Automated code build, test, and deployment through Jenkins pipelines  
- Security and compliance gates (e.g. scanning Terraform configs for misconfigurations)  
- Notification integrations (e.g. Slack alerts) for feedback loops  

The goal is to deliver a reproducible, maintainable, and secure deployment pipeline.

---

## Features

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform  
- Modular configuration for components: VPC, S3, RDS, Security Groups, etc.  
- Jenkins server provisioning and configuration  
- CI/CD pipeline stages: build â†’ test â†’ deploy  
- Security scanning tools such as Checkov & Snyk  
- Slack notifications for pipeline status/alerts  

---

## Architecture

Hereâ€™s a high-level view of how things are laid out:

1. **GitHub**: stores Terraform code, Jenkinsfile, and all configurations.  
2. **Terraform**: used to provision AWS infrastructure (networking, storage, databases, IAM, etc.).  
3. **Jenkins (on EC2)**:  
   - Executes pipeline defined in `Jenkinsfile`.  
   - Runs Terraform apply/destroy, application build / test / deploy.  
   - Plugins: Slack, Blue Ocean, Stage View, etc.  
4. **Security / Compliance**:  
   - Checkov scans Terraform code before applying.  
   - Snyk can be used for dependency / vulnerability scanning.  
5. **Notifications**: Slack channel(s) configured to receive alerts for pipeline failures or important events.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before you begin:

- AWS account with permissions to provision necessary resources (EC2, IAM, RDS, VPC, etc.)  
- Terraform installed locally (version â‰¥ *insert version*)  
- Jenkins-compatible instance (AMI/OS) or knowledge of setting up Jenkins in EC2  
- Git and GitHub account access  
- Slack workspace (if using Slack notifications)  
- Access / keys / IAM roles for managing AWS infrastructure  

---

## Getting Started

Below are the steps to get the pipeline up and running.

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akupheaws/Complete-Terraform-Jenkins-CICD-Pipeline-Project.git
